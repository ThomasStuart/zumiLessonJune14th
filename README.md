# Zumi Lesson June 14th:  Using IR sensor to determine route 


Today’s lesson, we used the zumi IR sensors to determine the route Zumi drove.  If the left sensor was detecting an object, Zumi would drive in a square.  If the right sensor was detected, zumi would drive in a S like shape.   We also incorporated Zumi’s LCD screen to display the options.
